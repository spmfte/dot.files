# Dotfiles

## Overview

This repository quietly organizes my dotfiles and configurations across a variety of systems. It's a simple, no-frills approach to keeping my development environment synchronized and tidy, whether I'm working on a Linux laptop or a Mac desktop.

## Structure

### Common

The `common` directory is where I keep configurations that are shared across all systems. This includes essentials like Neovim and Tmux setups, along with a few scripts and shell configurations that I find handy.

- **Neovim (`nvim`)**: Just my Neovim setup with some lua configurations.
- **Tmux (`tmux`)**: Basic Tmux configurations to keep things running smoothly.
- **Scripts (`scripts`)**: A couple of utility scripts for Linux and MacOS.
- **Window Managers (`wm`)**: Configs for AwesomeWM and others I occasionally dabble in.
- **Shell (`zsh`)**: Zsh configurations with a few color schemes.

### System-Specific

Each system gets its own directory. Currently, there's just a setup for my ASUS FX505DT, but I plan to add more as I go. These are mostly for unique tweaks that don't fit into the common bucket.

- **ASUS FX505DT (`ASUS-FX505DT`)**: Specific configs for my ASUS laptop.
- **Other Systems**: Directories like `MacBook-Pro-M1-2020`, `Lenovo-Yoga-710`, etc., are placeholders for future use.

## Philosophy

This repo is my humble attempt to keep things organized without overcomplicating them. It's a continuous work in progress, and I tweak it as I learn and grow in my journey as a developer.

Feel free to browse around, and if something catches your eye or if you have a suggestion, I'm all ears!
