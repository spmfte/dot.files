## üí° How to Use

To use any of these scripts, you may want to add their location to your `PATH` environment variable or create a symlink to a directory already in your `PATH`. Alternatively, you can run the script by specifying the full path to the script file.

Example:
```bash
/path/to/Custom\ Scripts/script_name.sh
```

Replace /path/to/Custom\ Scripts/ with the actual path to the "Custom Scripts" directory, and script_name.sh with the script you want to run.
